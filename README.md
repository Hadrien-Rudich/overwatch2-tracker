**Disclaimer:** This side project of mine is WIP and merely constitutes a means to hone my skills and get better at this new field of work.

As such, I cannot guarantee stability, continued support or development. Having invested a significant number of hours in this endeavour, I will however do my best to keep it up and running.

As of January 2024, the project is yet to be deployed but can be accessed locally, see below instructions.
